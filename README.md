# Test github flatdata

Based on https://github.com/githubocto/flat-demo-xlsx


## summary.jsonfile

The file suffix is `jsonfile` so that the flatdata viewer doesn't advertise it.

The file is generated from `.github/scripts/postprocess.py`, and can be customized there. The values show up [here](https://statcan.github.io/hackathon-ginyu-force/index-en.html)
