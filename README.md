# ESTMA Open Data Repository

> **ðŸ›ˆ Just looking for the data?**
>
> It's all in `estma-payments.csv` at the root of this repository. Have fun! ðŸš€

The Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act helps the Government of Canada
deter corruption in the extractive sector. Extractive entities â€” oil, gas, and
mining businesses â€” that are active in Canada must publicly disclose certain
types of payments made to governments in Canada and abroad.

This repository contains that payments data (see `estma-payments.csv`) â€“ as well
as some notebooks (see `notebooks/`) that analyze it â€“ that you can use freely
for analysis.

## Using the Data

## Why the Weird Extension on `summary.jsonfile`?

The `summary.jsonfile` is just a few lines of JSON that provide the data for high
level indicators on [the website][website]. It isn't intended for human consumption.

The GitHub Flat Viewer is hard-coded to list all JSON files in the repository, no
matter what. So we change the extension so it doesn't show up in that tool. ðŸ˜Ž
